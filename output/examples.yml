Small and concise, how it should be!\nRun it:</p>\n<pre><code>$ enqueuer enqueuer-repo-hit.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>What if I want to mock a http server and hit it at the same time, you may ask. Not a big deal for enqueuer lovers:</p>\n<pre><code>name: readme self-test\npublishers:\n-   type: http\n    url: http://localhost:9085/readme-example\n    method: POST\n    payload: does enqueuer rock?\n    onMessageReceived:\n        script: doubleStatus = statusCode * 2\n        assertions:\n            -   expect: body\n                toBeEqualTo: `mock response`\n            -   expect: doubleStatus\n                toBeGreaterThan: 300\nsubscriptions:\n-   type: http\n    name: mock endpoint\n    endpoint: /readme-example\n    port: 9085\n    method: POST\n    response:\n        status: 200\n        payload: mock response\n    onMessageReceived:\n        assertions:\n        -   expect: message.body\n            toContain: `enqueuer`\n        -   name: failing test\n            expectToBeTruthy: false\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the second subscription assertion is a failing one. By running this example, we get this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ nqr http-self-test.yml\n   [FAIL]      readme self-test                                                   6 tests passing of 7 (85.71%) ran in 37ms\n   [FAIL] enqueuer                                                                6 tests passing of 7 (85.71%) ran in 42ms\n               enqueuer › readme self-test › mock endpoint › failing test\n                           Expecting 'false' to be true. Received: false\n</code></pre>\n<p>I told you it was simple.\nNow, let's say you want to mix different protocols to test a bit more complex flow.\nHow about publishing an amqp message and making sure that, once a service consumes that message an endpoint of your is hit?\nIn order to achieve that, we have to make use of a <a href=\"#plugins\">plugin</a>, given that amqp support is provided by a plugin.\nIn this scenario, we're talking about the <a href=\"https://github.com/enqueuer-land/enqueuer-plugin-amqp\">amqp plugin</a>.\nOnce we get this <a href=\"#plugin_installation\">plugin installed</a> we are able to create and run files like this:</p>\n<pre><code>publishers:\n-   type: amqp\n    payload: 123456\n    exchange: enqueuer.exchange\n    routingKey: enqueuer.readme.routing.key\nsubscriptions:\n-   type: http\n    endpoint: /polyglot-flow\n    port: 8080\n    method: GET\n    response:\n        status: 200\n        payload: polyglot message\n    onMessageReceived:\n        assertions:\n        -   expect: message.body\n            toContain: 123456\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now go nuts!\nIt's all yours.

distributions.\nTherefore, if you run:</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install --global enqueuer\n$ mkdir ~/.nqr\n$ cd ~/.nqr\n$ npm install enqueuer-plugin-amqp\n$ nqr -p amqp\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'll see that the <code>enqueuer-plugin-amqp</code> plugin will be loaded.\nEvery enqueuer compatible module gets implicitly loaded.\nIn order to be enqueuer compatible, a module has to have an <code>entryPoint</code> exported function in its main file and, in its package.json file, it has to have either 'enqueuer' or 'nqr' as keywords.</p>\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-stacker\"
