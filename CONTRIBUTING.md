Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!
Contributions are welcome, I'm very liberal accepting pull requests.
Even if you can't figure out how to get the build working, etc.
Feel free to reach me out anytime at guilherme.moraes@outlook.com

## New Stuff

If you are opening a pull request/issue/suggestion (*thanks!*), please include:

- a description of the fix/improvement
- test(s) that could prove that the sutff is working

## Running the tests

To build:

  ```npm run build```

To run the test:
  
   ```npm tst```

Or, just:
  
  ```npm run all```

And get everything at the same time.

## Writing commits
Instead of the usual `$ git commit -m "my message"`, use `$ npm run commit`. This helps to write a pretty and formatted commit message that triggers a proper release version.
